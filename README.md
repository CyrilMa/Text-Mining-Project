--- FeaturesEngineering.ipynb ---
In this notebook, you will find all the work we have done too build our features : Doc2Vec et TfIdf for text features. Then generation of the graph features. And output of our training and testing set.

--- LgbmTrainPredict.ipynb ---
This notebook uses our improved training and testing set to train a classifier using LGBM and then output a prediction for the testing set. You can see our optimized parameters.

--- NNTrainPredict.ipynb ---
This notebook uses Keras library on our improved training and testing set to train a 1500-1500 Neural Network and then output a prediction for the testing set
